  \class TasServiceManager
  \brief TasServiceManager manages the service commands used by qttas components.

  TasServiceManager is the manager for the commands in the service architecture
  used by qttas components. The service requests are implemented using a relatively
  standard form of the chain of responsibility pattern. TasServiceManager class
  takes care of the command execution and management. The command implementations
  only need to concern with the actual command implementation.

  Commands which are reqistered to the manager will be invoked on all
  service requests untill on command consumed the request. This is done
  by returning "true" from the execute method.
